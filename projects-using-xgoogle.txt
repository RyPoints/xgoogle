Here is a list of projects that other people have done, that use this library:

* fimap  --  http://code.google.com/p/fimap/

  fimap is a little python tool which can find, prepare, audit, exploit and
  even google automaticly for local and remote file inclusion bugs in webapps.

* Top40  --  http://github.com/staticd/Top40

  This program grabs the top 40 artists played on Alt Nation (a Sirius XM
  radio channel) over the past week and runs a Google search on each artist in
  an attempt to find links to free music from the artist being searched.
  Thanks to xgoogle, I have an interface with Google to make this program
  successful.
